# Understanding-Lego-sets-popularity

Most of us have heard or played with Legos at least once. Have you ever wondered why this toy has become so popular? </br>
Using analysis in PostgreSQL and visualization in R, I want to answer these questions:
1) What is the average number of Lego sets released per year?
2) What is the average number of Lego parts per year?
3) What are the 5 most popular colors used in Lego parts?
4) What proportion of Lego parts are transparent?
5) What are the 5 rarest categories of lego bricks?
6) Summarize my findings
